            <p class="titlep1">Stories as Networks</p>
            <p class="descriptionp1">Jorge Luis Borges was an Argentinian writer famous for his short stories that deal with labyrinths, dreams, religion, and mathematical ideas (particularly set theory concepts like infinity and cardinality). His circuitous and meandering prose, full of allusions and vivid imagery, is a good way to think about the web as a network that has many nodes and many connections that continuously folds upon itself. It is the act of navigating through this maze that brings meaning to the web experience.</p>

            <p class="titlep2">Elastic Collection</p>
            <p class="descriptionp2">Anything that you have an accumulation of can be a collection. An archive is a collection of historical documents or records. Not all collections are archives, but many become relevant with time. For our next project you’re tasked with creating a collection of 25 to 50 items. Any time you see a multiplicity of an object, you begin to notice similarities and contexts in a new way. Seeing multiple of an object allows for this kind of in depth research that observing one object does not. The way the object is documented (consider the various image making techniques we’ve explored this semester) and organized helps direct the viewer on how the object is meant to be experienced.</p>

            <p class="titlep3">New York City in Data</p>
            <p class="descriptionp3">Data is all around us and can help us understand new aspects about our environment. Using the New York City open data, you will select a dataset to work with. New York collects data ranging from parking violations to squirrel census. On its own, the data is a set of numbers that are difficult to comprehend without a visualization. Look through your chosen data and consider how you can tell a story through different subsets of it — you do not need to include all of it. Consider the relationship between the form, the story, and the data itself. How does the data’s container help encourage an understanding of the data not possible without it? Feel free to add in mixed media content to help tell this story, and avoid using traditional data visualizations such as bar graphs and pie charts.</p>
